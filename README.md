# My-AI-Projects
Hi, I am Rajitha Amarasinghe and pursuing a path in AI and ML. Included here are the milestones in my learning journey.

Most importantly I have been offered a scholarship by the www.udacity.com website, with a sponsorship from AWS. I had to study for three levels. At present (2023.07.20) I am following the third and final stage.

While studying there were places where as students we had to implement what we have learnt and complete predefined projects. I have included almost all the projects I have done up to now.  

Also, I am going to include all the projects which I will have to do in the future in my learning journey.
